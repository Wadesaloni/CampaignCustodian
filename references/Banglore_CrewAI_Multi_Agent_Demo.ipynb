    "\n",
    "CrewAI is a framework for building autonomous AI agent teams that can collaborate to solve complex tasks. Instead of using a single AI model, you create a \"crew\" of specialized agents that each have:\n",
    "- **Specific Roles**: Defined expertise areas (Researcher, Writer, Analyst, etc.)\n",
    "- **Clear Goals**: What each agent is trying to accomplish\n",
    "- **Assigned Tools**: Functions and capabilities available to each agent\n",
    "- **Backstory**: Context about the agent's expertise and personality\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Why Use Multi-Agent Systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Specialization**: Each agent focuses on what it does best\n",
    "- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents can work on different tasks simultaneously\n",
    "- **Quality**: Agents review and refine each other's work (like human collaboration)\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Easy to add more agents for complex workflows\n",
    "- **Transparency**: You can see what each agent is thinking and doing\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Failed tasks can be retried or delegated to other agents"

    "## 💡 Section 5: Key Takeaways and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### CrewAI Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specialization**: Each agent has a specific expertise and role\n",
    "2. **Collaboration**: Agents build on each other's work\n",
    "3. **Quality Control**: Different perspectives improve output quality\n",
    "4. **Explainability**: You can see what each agent is thinking\n",
    "5. **Scalability**: Easy to add more agents for complex problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Multi-Agent Systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use CrewAI when:**\n",
    "- Task requires multiple perspectives and expertise areas\n",
    "- You need to break down complex problems into subtasks\n",
    "- Quality is more important than speed\n",
    "- You want transparency in AI decision-making\n",
    "- You're building intelligent automation workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't use CrewAI when:**\n",
    "- You need real-time, low-latency responses\n",
    "- Task is simple and requires only one skill\n",
    "- Cost optimization is the primary concern\n",
    "- You need to integrate with strict APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clear Agent Definitions**: Define roles, goals, and backstories precisely\n",
    "2. **Task Dependencies**: Sequence tasks logically, using outputs as inputs\n",
    "3. **Tool Integration**: Give agents the right tools for their job\n",
    "4. **Iterative Refinement**: Start simple, then add complexity\n",
    "5. **Monitoring**: Track agent performance and refine prompts based on results\n",
    "6. **Error Handling**: Design tasks with failure recovery in mind"
